# MedECC


## Overview
This is a project at UCSD as part of the course CSE 145 and CSE 237D.

MedECC is an open-source telemedicine application that allows clinicians to better scale personnel resources using an Internet of Things system. We are bringing the benefits of modern technology into in-patient care by using modern smartphones to act as a communication hub for an internet-of things system. 
The app would enable doctors to make quick changes without having to physically change settings in the room of the patient by viewing the condition of the patients remotely. They would then be able to coordinate with specialists, communicate with other doctors, and send new instructions to the ventilator, all without having to be in the same room as the patient. It would expedite care to patients, increase the efficiency of doctors, resources, and improve care for all. The IOT system includes a wirelessly connected ventilator that can be remotely monitored and adjusted.



## Project Approach, Objectives
Monitoring and control application that connects to our prototype ventilator. 
This would implement and include the functionalities of all of our groups. 




## Groups
### Control Group
The goal of the control group is to implement several types of control algorithms that are frequently-used on ventilators for hospital use. 

### Modem Group
The goal of the modem group is to implement a software modem for an Arduino DUE like board in order to enable communication between ventilator and the remote device (mobile device). 

### OS Group
The goal of the OS group is to create an interface that allows the user and different parts of the system to communicate and share data with each other.

### UI Group
The goal of the user interface group is to create an interface which allows for patient video and audio monitoring, ventilator integration, multimedia communication, and patient and staff administration in user-friendly and reliable way.
